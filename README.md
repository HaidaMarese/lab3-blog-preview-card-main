## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5 (Grid, components, utility classes)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Refactoring this project helped me:

- Use Bootstrap’s card component to create a more consistent layout
- Use utility classes for margin, padding, and typography adjustments
- Utilize Bootstrap's grid system to create responsive layouts

### Continued development

I plan to continue enhancing this project by:

- Experimenting with more advanced Bootstrap components like carousels or modals
- Adding custom styles by overriding Bootstrap variables using Sass
- Ensuring full responsiveness for larger devices

### Useful resources
